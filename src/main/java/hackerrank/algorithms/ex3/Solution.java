 * <p>
 * You are given an array of integers of size N. You need to print the sum of the elements in the array,
 * keeping in mind that some of those integers may be quite large.
 * <p>
 * Input Format
 * The first line of the input consists of an integer N. The next line contains N space-separated integers
 * contained in the array.
 * <p>
 * Output Format
 * Print a single value equal to the sum of the elements in the array.
 * <p>
 * Constraints
 * 1<= N <=10
 * 0<= A[i] <= 10^10
 * <p>
 * Sample Input
 * 5
 * 1000000001 1000000002 1000000003 1000000004 1000000005
 * <p>
 * Output
 * 5000000015
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * The range of the 32-bit integer is (-2^31) to (2^31-1) or [-2147483648,2147483647].
 * When we add several integer values, the resulting sum might exceed the above range. You might need to use long long int in C/C++ or long data type in Java to store such sums.
